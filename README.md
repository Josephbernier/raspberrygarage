# raspberrygarage

This is a smart house project with Raspberry pi 3 board 
It is a project that I just started, it is a project of home automation (garage intelligent),
 it allows a remote control of its garage via the cloud. 
It also has sensors that allow you to open the garage as soon as you approach it.

it's just a begin of this project, i will improve my version and add new features
